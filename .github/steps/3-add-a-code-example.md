## Step 3: Add a code example

_Great job adding an image to the file :tada:_

Let's add some code blocks. Code blocks can render differently depending on the language.

### Example 1

<pre>
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```
</pre>

#### How it looks

```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```

### Example 2

<pre>
``` javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```
</pre>

#### How it looks

```javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```

### :keyboard: Activity: Adding a code example

1. As you did before, edit the file in this pull request.
1. In the file, add the correct Markdown for a code example of your choice.
1. Use the **Preview** tab to check your Markdown formatting.
1. Commit your changes.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.

### Additional Information

Code blocks can be used to display code snippets in various programming languages. To create a code block, use triple backticks (```) before and after the code. You can also specify the language for syntax highlighting by adding the language name after the opening triple backticks.

#### Example

<pre>
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
</pre>

#### How it looks

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
